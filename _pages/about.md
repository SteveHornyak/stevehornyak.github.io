Hello, my name is Steve Hornyak. I am a Hardware Engineer based in Seattle, Washington.

I graduated from the University of Southern California in May 2022 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering and Computer Science. During my time at USC, I took various courses surrounding topics such as MOS VLSI Circuit Design, SoC Design, Computer Systems and Architecture, Embedded Systems Design, Distributed Systems, IoT and Digital Circuit Design. 

Along with this classwork, I have interned at RoviSys as a Systems Engineering Co-op, programming Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) along with documenting the design process and specifications. Along with my internship experience, I was also a member of the USC FSAE Electric Racecar Team, specifically as a Systems sub-team lead. While on the team, I had many roles such as adhering to guidelines and design specifications, design and implement a functional driver interface for the car and teach other Systems team members basic programming and electronic information, especially microcontroller programming and design. As a result of my classwork and experience, I have experience and proficiency with C/C++, Embedded System Design, Cadence VLSI CAD tools, Git and Verilog.

Along with my experience in terms of Hardware Engineering, I also have plenty of classwork and experience in the Software Engineering field. Along with my skills in C/C++ and Git, I also have experience with Python, Java, SQL, OpenGL and Embedded C. Furthermore, I have a great background with REST APIs, IP Networking, Algorithm Development, Computer Graphics, Video Game Programming and Operating System Development. My work experience in the Software Engineering field comes from when I interned at the USC Credit Union, developing algorithms and data management for the credit union employees and customers.

On a more personal level, I like to read, play and listen to music and enjoy fitness, such as weightlifting.
